FILE NAME	                 CLASS NAME    	DESCRIPTION
Time.cpp	                  TIME	        This class is used to take start and end time as input from user and calculate 
                                          total hours based on that.
                                    
Date.cpp	                  DATE         	This class is used to take start and end date as input from user and calculate 
                                          total days based  on that.
                                    
Account.cpp	                account	      This class is used to derive two other classes to store, display and check 
                                          accounts of both users and admins
                                          
Vehicle.cpp         	      Vehicle	      This class is used to derive two other classes to display, select and rent 
                                          vehicles. 
                                          
Rent.cpp	                   -	          This file contains code for calculating rent

VEHICLE RENTAL SYSTEM.cpp	   -	          This is the main code for project using all other files
